# Changelog

All notable changes to the VBA Runner extension are documented here.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Code Lens "Run" now uses unsaved editor content** — Previously, clicking "Run" above a Sub/Function read the file from disk, ignoring any unsaved edits in the editor. The procedure appeared in Code Lens (parsed from the live buffer) but was not found at runtime, resulting in "Sub or Function not defined". Now the in-memory document text is used whenever available.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Added Marketplace icon.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Initial release: VBA execution engine, Code Lens (Run / Debug / Test), LSP-based diagnostics, syntax highlighting, and basic refactoring commands.
